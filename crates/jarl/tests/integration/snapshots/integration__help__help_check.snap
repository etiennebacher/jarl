Check a set of files or directories

Usage: jarl check [OPTIONS] <FILES>...

Arguments:
  <FILES>...
          List of files or directories to check or fix lints, for example `jarl check .`.

Options:
  -f, --fix
          Automatically fix issues detected by the linter.

  -u, --unsafe-fixes
          Include fixes that may not retain the original intent of the  code.

      --fix-only
          Apply fixes to resolve lint violations, but don't report on leftover violations. Implies `--fix`.

      --allow-dirty
          Apply fixes even if the Git branch is not clean, meaning that there are uncommitted files.

      --allow-no-vcs
          Apply fixes even if there is no version control system.

  -s, --select <SELECT>
          Names of rules to include, separated by a comma (no spaces). This also accepts names of groups of rules, such as "PERF".
          
          [default: ]

  -e, --extend-select <EXTEND_SELECT>
          Like `--select` but adds additional rules in addition to those already specified.
          
          [default: ]

  -i, --ignore <IGNORE>
          Names of rules to exclude, separated by a comma (no spaces). This also accepts names of groups of rules, such as "PERF".
          
          [default: ]

  -w, --with-timing
          Show the time taken by the function.

  -m, --min-r-version <MIN_R_VERSION>
          The mimimum R version to be used by the linter. Some rules only work starting from a specific version.

      --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
          Output serialization format for violations.

          Possible values:
          - full:    Print diagnostics with full context using annotated code snippets
          - concise: Print diagnostics in a concise format, one per line
          - github:  Print diagnostics as GitHub format
          - json:    Print diagnostics as JSON
          
          [default: full]

      --assignment <ASSIGNMENT>
          [DEPRECATED: use `[lint.assignment]` in jarl.toml] Assignment operator to use, can be either `<-` or `=`.

      --no-default-exclude
          Do not apply the default set of file patterns that should be excluded.

      --statistics
          Show counts for every rule with at least one violation.

      --add-jarl-ignore[=<REASON>]
          Automatically insert a `# jarl-ignore` comment to suppress all violations.
          The default reason can be customized with `--add-jarl-ignore="my_reason"`.
