    "text": "This file is for my own understand of Ruff so I can try to mimick it as best as possible. Ruff is a massive project and it’s hard to see how it actually works. I’m writing this because I learn something better when I have to explain it.\n\n\nThere are several kinds of settings:\n\nwhich rules should be applied?\nwhich files to parse?\nis caching enabled?\nshould fixes be applied?\n\nThere is a struct RuleTable that contains two RuleSets (which are basically lists): one to know if a specific rule is enabled, and one to know if a specific rule has an associated fix.\nCaching is mostly handled in ruff_cache but there’s also an enum Cache.\n\n\n\nTODO\nI have a hard time explaining how this works, there are multiple Structs related to paths and file patterns.\n\n\n\nThere are two important functions for this:\n\ncheck() takes the list of paths, config args, cache, etc. It resolves the paths, does more checks, runs lint_path() in parallel, aggregates the output and reports it.\nlint_path() is where we get the cached output if the file didn’t change, and then run the lint functions. Depending on whether we lint only or fix the file as well, this calls lint_only() or lint_fix(). Both of those functions call check_path() to generate the diagnostics (and lint_fix() then parses those diagnostics and loops through fixes until stability).\n\ncheck_path() creates a context that accumulates all the diagnostics. Again, it dispatches checks between several functions:\n\ncheck_tokens(): for cases like empty comment, invalid character, useless semicolon, etc.\ncheck_filepath(): for cases such as checking module imports, this kind of thing. I think I can ignore it.\ncheck_logical_lines(): whitespace after bracket, etc.\ncheck_ast() =&gt; the one I’m interested in.\n\n\n\n\nTaken from this file:\n\n[Checker] for AST-based lint rules.\nThe [Checker] is responsible for traversing over the AST, building up the [SemanticModel], and running any enabled [Rule]s at the appropriate place and time.\nThe [Checker] is structured as a single pass over the AST that proceeds in “evaluation” order. That is: the [Checker] typically iterates over nodes in the order in which they’re evaluated by the Python interpreter. This includes, e.g., deferring function body traversal until after parent scopes have been fully traversed. Individual rules may also perform internal traversals of the AST.\nThe individual [Visitor] implementations within the [Checker] typically proceed in four steps:\n\nBinding: Bind any names introduced by the current node.\nTraversal: Recurse into the children of the current node.\nClean-up: Perform any necessary clean-up after the current node has been fully traversed.\nAnalysis: Run any relevant lint rules on the current node.\n\nThe first three steps together compose the semantic analysis phase, while the last step represents the lint-rule analysis phase. In the future, these steps may be separated into distinct passes over the AST.\n\nSince I focus on lint-rule analysis for now and ignore the semantic analysis. Only point 4 is interesting for us.\nThere is one giant Checker struct, with some fields that aren’t necessary here, either because they are related to the formatter, to the semantic analysis, or to Python itself:\npub(crate) struct Checker&lt;'a&gt; {\n    /// The [`Parsed`] output for the source code.\n    parsed: &'a Parsed&lt;ModModule&gt;,\n    /// An internal cache for parsed string annotations\n    parsed_annotations_cache: ParsedAnnotationsCache&lt;'a&gt;,\n    /// The [`Parsed`] output for the type annotation the checker is currently in.\n    parsed_type_annotation: Option&lt;&'a ParsedAnnotation&gt;,\n    /// The [`Path`] to the file under analysis.\n    path: &'a Path,\n    /// The [`Path`] to the package containing the current file.\n    package: Option&lt;PackageRoot&lt;'a&gt;&gt;,\n    /// The [`flags::Noqa`] for the current analysis (i.e., whether to respect suppression\n    /// comments).\n    noqa: flags::Noqa,\n    /// The [`NoqaMapping`] for the current analysis (i.e., the mapping from line number to\n    /// suppression commented line number).\n    noqa_line_for: &'a NoqaMapping,\n    /// The [`LinterSettings`] for the current analysis, including the enabled rules.\n    pub(crate) settings: &'a LinterSettings,\n    /// The [`Locator`] for the current file, which enables extraction of source code from byte\n    /// offsets.\n    locator: &'a Locator&lt;'a&gt;,\n    /// The [`Stylist`] for the current file, which detects the current line ending, quote, and\n    /// indentation style.\n    stylist: &'a Stylist&lt;'a&gt;,\n    /// The [`Indexer`] for the current file, which contains the offsets of all comments and more.\n    indexer: &'a Indexer,\n    /// The [`Importer`] for the current file, which enables importing of other modules.\n    importer: Importer&lt;'a&gt;,\n    /// A set of deferred nodes to be visited after the current traversal (e.g., function bodies).\n    visit: deferred::Visit&lt;'a&gt;,\n    /// A set of deferred nodes to be analyzed after the AST traversal (e.g., `for` loops).\n    analyze: deferred::Analyze,\n    /// The cumulative set of diagnostics computed across all lint rules.\n    diagnostics: RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Diagnostic&gt;&gt;,\n    /// The end offset of the last visited statement.\n    last_stmt_end: TextSize,\n    /// The target [`PythonVersion`] for version-dependent checks.\n    target_version: PythonVersion,\n\n\n    /////////// Etienne: not needed\n    pub(crate) module: Module&lt;'a&gt;,\n    pub(crate) source_type: PySourceType,\n    cell_offsets: Option&lt;&'a CellOffsets&gt;,\n    notebook_index: Option&lt;&'a NotebookIndex&gt;,\n    semantic: SemanticModel&lt;'a&gt;,\n    flake8_bugbear_seen: RefCell&lt;FxHashSet&lt;TextRange&gt;&gt;,\n    docstring_state: DocstringState,\n    semantic_checker: SemanticSyntaxChecker,\n    semantic_errors: RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;SemanticSyntaxError&gt;&gt;,\n    ///////////\n\n}\nThe interesting part, where the checks actually happen, is the visit_*() functions at the end of this file, e.g. visit_stmt(). A big part of those functions is dedicated to steps 1-3 mentioned above in which I’m not interested. The lint analysis is done by a single line: analyze::statement(stmt, self). This calls the functions in the file analyze/statement.rs.\nThis file contains a huge match call with every type of statement (for loop, if condition, function definition, assign, expr, etc.). In each of those types of statement, they check whether a relevant rule is enabled or not, and apply it if it is.\nThis was for visit_stmt(), but there are other visiting functions, such as visit_expr(). This follows the same org as before: the large majority of the function is dedicated to the semantic analysis, and then a few lines are dedicated to linting rules. There’s analyze::expression(expr, self) which does the same as analyze::statement(expr, self) but this time the match call is made on the type of expression (tuple, list, dict, f-string, etc.).\nThere are a bunch of visit_*() functions: visit_parameter(), visit_parameters(), visit_body(), visit_f_string_element(), etc.\nMost of the rest of the file is dedicated to deferred visit, which concerns semantic analysis.\nThe final function of the file is check_ast(), which takes a path, builds a Checker, and applies the checks. A bunch of those are related to semantic analysis, but those I’m probably interested in is visit_body(). This function calls analyze::suite(body, self) but I’m not interested in this (I’m not sure why the two checks in this function are here). The important part is the for loop:\nfn visit_body(&mut self, body: &'a [Stmt]) {\n    // Step 4: Analysis\n    analyze::suite(body, self);\n\n    // Step 2: Traversal\n    for stmt in body {\n        self.visit_stmt(stmt);\n    }\n}\nPROBLEM: visit_body() is not enough. I need to go through the deferred analysis as well because not everything there is related to semantic analysis. For instance, we have:\ncheck_ast()\n-&gt; visit_deferred()\n-&gt; visit_deferred_functions()\n-&gt; visit_parameters()\nand visit_parameters() has a part dedicated to semantic analysis but also a call to analyze::parameters(parameters, self). I guess analyze/parameters.rs is where we could detect duplicated arg names for instance.\nSO I GUESS the big question is: should I keep the deferred part? They do this because the semantic analysis absolutely needs to evaluate things in the right order, meaning all the top level objects before going in the body of functions for instance. Since I don’t do semantic analysis but only pattern based detection, could I bypass that?\n\n\n\nRuff has a struct Message:\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\npub enum Message {\n    Diagnostic(DiagnosticMessage),\n    SyntaxError(SyntaxErrorMessage),\n}\nThis contains two types of messages: Diagnostic and SyntaxError.\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\npub struct DiagnosticMessage {\n    pub kind: DiagnosticKind,\n    pub range: TextRange,\n    pub fix: Option&lt;Fix&gt;,\n    pub parent: Option&lt;TextSize&gt;,\n    pub file: SourceFile,\n    pub noqa_offset: TextSize,\n}\n\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\npub struct SyntaxErrorMessage {\n    pub message: String,\n    pub range: TextRange,\n    pub file: SourceFile,\n}\nMessage has a lot of methods, for instance to return the message itself, the suggested fix, whether the violation has a fix or not, etc.\n\n\n\nImportant structs:\n\nFixResult contains the output, after applying the fixes:\n\npub(crate) struct FixResult {\n    /// The resulting source code, after applying all fixes.\n    pub(crate) code: String,\n    /// The number of fixes applied for each [`Rule`].\n    pub(crate) fixes: FixTable,\n    /// Source map for the fixed source code.\n    pub(crate) source_map: SourceMap,\n}\nTwo main functions:\n\nfix_file() takes a list of Message that contain everything needed (original code, location, replacement, fix applicability, etc.), and only keeps those that have the correct fix applicability (for instance allowing or disallowing unsafe fixes). It runs apply_fixes() on those.\napply_fixes() is where the replacement actually happens. It goes through every pair of rule-fix but first they sort them (see below). There are also the concepts of “edits” and “isolation”. Importantly, fixes that concern locations that already received another fix are skipped. So basically they start from the top of the file and apply fixes in order of appearance (I suppose this is what the “sort” mentioned above is about). When they apply a fix, they modify the last position modified and the next fix to be applied cannot be applied before this last_pos.\n\nConcepts that I need to understand:\n\nLocator: a struct that takes the content of a file as well as the index of line start positions. This index is OnceCell&lt;LineIndex&gt;. OnceCell kinda allows to cache results so that we access LineIndex only once. LineIndex has many helpers to quickly convert an offset to a (line, col) position. It can also return the entire line that matches a certain offset (let’s say we have a linebreak at offset 10 and we ask for the entire line at offset 15, then it returns bytes 10-end of line).\nwhat is the difference between “fix” and “edit”? An Edit is a single action: replace, insert, or delete a specific content at a specific TextRange. A Fix contains all the edits necessary to fix the lint, so it may contain one or more Edits.\nisolation\n\nHow do they sort fixes? They compare 2 rules and their fixes but actually the 2 rules are only useful in some specific cases (so unclear whether I’ll actually need that). Then they only compare the start index of each fix."
