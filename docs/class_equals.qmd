# class_equals
## What it does
Checks for usage of `class(...) == "some_class"` and class(...) %in% "some_class".

## Why is this bad?
An R object can have several classes. Therefore, `class(...) == "some_class"`
would return a logical vector with as many values as the object has classes,
which is rarely desirable.

It is better to use `inherits(..., "some_class")` instead. `inherits()`
checks whether any of the object's classes match the desired class.

The same rationale applies to `class(...) %in% "some_class"`.

## Example
```{r}
is_lm <- class(x) == "lm"
```

Use instead:
```{r}
is_lm <- inherits(x, "lm")
```
